# Face-Mask-Detector

A simple face mask detector using OpenCV and Dlib.

Amid covid-19 situation, we can help hospitals or any essential service
to detect mask for people entering the premises.
 
## Requirements:
    - Dlib
    - OpenCV
    
## Future improvements:
    - To detect face we can use MTCNN model.
    - After using face alignment we can then check mouth region.
    - Custom made mask detector can be made using CNN model.
